HR Analytics Dashboard Project Summary
​This project is a visualization of Human Resources data, likely created using Power BI, focused on analyzing and identifying drivers of Employee Attrition.
​1. Overview and Key Metrics (KPIs)
​The dashboard provides a snapshot of the employee base and the overall attrition rate:
​Total Employee Count: 1,470  
​Total Attrition: 237.0  
​Attrition Rate: 16.1%  
​Average Employee Age: 36.92  
​Average Salary: $6.50K  
​Average Years at Company: 7.0  
​📈 Analysis and Breakdowns
​The project includes several visualizations breaking down attrition across different employee characteristics:  
​Attrition by Department (Filter): The data is initially filtered by department, showing three main groups: Human Resources, Research & Development, and Sales.  
​Attrition by Gender: Shows the count of male (150) versus female (87) employees who have left the company.  
​Attrition by Education: Breaks down attrition based on education fields such as Life Sciences, Marketing, Medical, and Technical Degree.  
​The largest percentages shown are 38% and 27% (Medical).  
​Attrition by Age: Segments attrition into five age groups: 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, and 55+.  
​The 26-35 age group has the highest attrition count (44).  
​Attrition by Salary Slab: Divides attrition counts into salary ranges (Upto 5k, 5k-10k, 10k-15k, 15k+).  
​The 5k-10k slab has the highest count of attrition (163).  
​Attrition by Job Role (Top 4): This visualization highlights the job roles with the highest number of attritions.  
​The top job roles for attrition are Laboratory Technician (62), Sales Executive (57), Research Scientist (47), and Sales Representative (33).  
​Attrition by Year at Company: Shows how attrition is distributed based on the number of years employees have been with the company.  
​Job Satisfaction: This table shows the total count of attrition (237.0) broken down by Job Role and a Job Satisfaction rating (1, 2, 3, 4).  
​The total attrition counts for several Job Roles are listed, such as Laboratory Technician (62.0), Sales Executive (57.0), and Research Scientist (47.0).  
​The overall purpose of this project is to provide a comprehensive, visual analysis of employee attrition to help the Human Resources department identify trends and potential areas for intervention.
